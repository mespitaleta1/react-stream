## Overview

### The challenge

The web app for streaming services was defined to let the users:

- Login to the app with their valid email and password, checking the credentials to get all the popular movies content.
- Get all the most recent movies content with by categories.
- Get in detail all the information about the movies content on the web app, as rating, and synopsis.
- Reproduce a trailer embedded video to get more details about the movie to want to enjoy using the web app.
- Navigate through the web app for categories, movies, and the principal content of the web app.

### Frontend

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next](https://nextjs.org/) - Next
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) - TypeScript

### Try on ReactStream

This project was built-in with Vite technologies, ones you fork the project and want to run it locally, follow this steps;

      npm install
      npm run dev

As mentioned before, this project include login validations to access, so the users must be provide a valid email (gmail or hotmail, for this case), and be register on the database, for that reason, if you want to get access you must log in with this credentials:

email: droscow4@gmail.com  
 Password: 12345

Keep in mind that the login will be validating the empty fields, so donâ€™t forget add it, otherwise, hope you enjoy it using ReactStream web app.

### Continued development

This is a basic or a minimum viable product for a streaming services web app to the users entertainment.
